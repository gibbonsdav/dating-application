# Dating Application

#### This is a form for applying to take someone's daughter out for a date

This project is written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. It shows form validation to show required fields have been completed and regex email validation as well.

This project does not have a backend to submit the form to, but when the user clicks the submit button they get a modal popup showing they have successfully completed the form and they have submitted.
